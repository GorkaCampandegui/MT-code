# ABOUT THE PROJECT

This repository collects all the code and datasets used to develop my Master Thesis project for the Master in Statistics for Data Science (Universidad Carlos III de Madrid). 

The thesis aims to develop a new automatic procedure to find an appropriate threshold for modelling peaks using the Generalized Pareto distribution. Several known methods are introduced first, and then the new method, based on Studentized residuals, is proposed. All the methods are applied to real and synthetic data, and finally a large simulation is made to compare the methods in terms of precision and computational cost.
